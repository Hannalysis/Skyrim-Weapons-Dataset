## The Brief

At School of Code, our team was challenged to build a RESTful API with a Dataset of our choice and deliver a functional MVP within just 2 days.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h3><u>MVP</u></h3>

- Convert Dataset from google sheets to json
- GET requests to show all weapons & get weapons by ID and name
- POST request to add a new weapon
- PATCH request to update a weapon

<h3><u>Update 1 - MS2</u></h3>

- Basic CSS and background image 

## Future Milestones

<h3><u>MS3</u></h3>
